      <p>"I am so pulling for this place, such a great vibe and cocktail menu if you are into cocktails.  I definitely will be back here, so ladies get that wine bucket to keep my bubbles chilled. Welcome to making it on my rotation list of places to drink....cheers!"--Denyce M.</p>
      <p>"We love a woman-owned, LGBTQ+ owned, POC-owned establishment! I've been meaning to come here for a long time and now that I live a bit closer in Uptown, I was able to walk here from Andersonville after grabbing lunch."--Andrew P.</p>
      <p>"Good place for those looking for some quality fun and cocktails. It's a tolerant place: black owned, queer owned, woman owned. Nobody's Darling gets its name from a poem by Alice Walker. Facts like that are fun to learn, and you can even read the poem since it's on the wall inside of the bar. This is a great spot for meeting all kinds of creative individuals."--Steve A.</p>
      <p>"We went early on a Saturday evening, and it was still quite busy. There's a nice outdoor patio and maybe two tables inside, then a long bar and some standing room along a counter in back. No service at the tables or outside; you order at the bar. Despite how busy it was, I was greeted quickly and got my drinks pretty fast. They were out of one of the ingredients needed 
        to make my first choice drink, the Silk Gardenias, so I instead opted for the Rose Parque, which was bubbly and refreshing and delicious. My husband enjoyed the Torii Old Fashioned and let me have a sip: it is hands-down one of the best old fashions I have ever had. Service was great. It was quite loud inside, even so early on a Saturday night, but the vibe was fun and everyone was friendly and cool."--Melissa S.</p>
      <p class="quote">&#10077;Don't know where to go at the weekend? 
        Imagination Bar is the best place.&#10078; &#8212; The Dude</p>
      <p>"No matter the time of day or day of the week, I'm always up for a trip to Nobody's Darling! I've stopped in after dinner on a weeknight to a surprisingly full (but not crowded) bar, sat outdoors during a weekend afternoon in the summertime, and chatted the night away in a very crowded space on a Saturday night. Nobody's Darling has range and I've loved it every single time I've stopped by."--Cassidy B.</p>
      <p>"On a beautiful Thursday evening, I decided to drive on over to Andersonville. It was worth the drive. The bartenders were friendly and the atmosphere was chill.
        No pictures because I was too caught up enjoying  the summer breeze on a 90 degree day and my Darling Old Fashioned cocktail."--Derria M.</p>
      <p>"Wow, what a fun spot. Went here on a first date and it was the perfect bar for it - lovely with awesome cocktails and an outdoor patio area. Felt a little European and loved the disco ball and dimmed lights. It's really a stellar cocktail bar!"--Megan C.</p>
      <p>"This place was everything I expect and more the bartenders had the best recommendations got to know our likes and recommended what we would appreciate. The vibe is great beautiful day for outdoor seating nice cold water for in between cocktails I thought I was going in for one drink stayed for four conversation with all different types of people my husband who doesn't like to try new things especially in environments 
        he's not used to had an amazing time so this location speaks volumes such a comfortable place such a beautiful vibe a must when visiting Andersonville enjoy!"--Michelle I.</p>

      <p>Imagination Bar, located in the prestigious St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan, 
        is known as the birthplace of the Bloody Mary. In 1934, bartender Fernand 
        Petiot curated the perfect recipe for a vodka and tomato juice-based cocktail
         and garnished it with a stalk of celery. Though the concoction was originally
          named Bloody Mary, the high-end bar renamed it Red Snapper to create a more 
          elegant name for the hotel’s elite clientele. No matter which name you use, 
        the drink remains the signature cocktail of the King Cole Bar. </p>
        <p>No list of bars is complete without representation from the Music City.
           Tootsies opened its doors in 1960 and have been delivering the best in 
           honkey-tonk ever since. Some of the nation’s most famous Country Music stars
            have played this iconic venue, including Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and 
            Patsy Klein. Patrons can explore the lounge’s three floors offering live music
             performances while sipping Tootsies’ 
          famous Apple Pie Shine. </p>
